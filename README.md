# alpha-noname
A little game that I am spinning up! Our hero gets lost somehow, and finds himself in a troubling situation. What adventures await him in this strange world? Wanna find out? Play it! No spoilers here :D Support it if you want more of it!

# This game is currently Linux-only.

If you want to see it on Windows, support me over on Patreon so I can replace my broken drive!

|Alternatively:
You could ```#include <windows.h>``` and replace all the sleep() lines with Sleep();, that should work it out for Windows. Or who knows, maybe it already works on Windows.. I wouldn't, I don't have a Windows install :P

# How to run?

Quite simple, actually. Fire up a terminal and clone this repo-

```git clone https://github.com/BahriCan/alpha-noname.git```

Then 

```cd alpha-noname```

Then just run the maingame executable with ```./maingame``` and there you have it! Enjoy!

If you wanna make changes to the source code, edit core.c and compile with your favorite C compiler I guess. I compile it with TCC!

# How to play?

Documentation will be released sooner or later.

A little game that I am spinning up! Our hero gets lost somehow, and finds himself in a troubling situation. What adventures await him in this strange world? Wanna find out? Play it! No spoilers here :D Support it if you want more of it!

# This game is currently Linux-only.

If you want to see it on Windows, support me over on Patreon so I can replace my broken drive!

|Alternatively:
You could ```#include <windows.h>``` and replace all the sleep() lines with Sleep();, that should work it out for Windows.
